**Title:** Patterns of de novo tandem repeat mutations and their role in autism.

**Year:** 2021

**URL:** https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-03078-7

**Catalog source:** GangSTR reference TR catalog

**Loci:** 90,175 TR loci with SISTR selection scores (repeat units 2-4bp)

**Reference genome:** hg38

**Description:** This study used GangSTR for TR genotyping and developed MonSTR for calling de novo TR mutations and SISTR for inferring selection coefficients at short TRs. The supplementary data contains genome-wide SISTR scores for TR loci genotyped with GangSTR.
